# BB84Simulation
This project simulates the bb84 protocol which is the quantum key distribution protocol.

## Running the project
Clone this repository and set BB84Simulation as the start up projcet. Press Start in Visual Studio to run the example.

## Environment
- KeyLength: KeyLength which Alice and Bob want to earn.
- CheckLength: Checkbits length which is used to check there is an eavesdropper.
- StepBits: Bits length which is used in one step of the protocol.
- Steps: Number of pattern with eavesdropper simulation.
